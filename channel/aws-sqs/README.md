# AWS SQS Channel

`AWS SQS` is a fully managed message queuing service. One can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available.

The implementation provides support for ingesting, processing incoming SQS messages into events consumed by BusinessEvents and converts events to outgoing SQS messages.

## Pre-requisites

* Install docker, since the bundled integration test's creates a light weight throw away container for all the tests. Existing tests were run again Docker v19.03.13.
* Have a AWS SQS service up and running and necessary access/secret keys available. 

Note - For integration tests, we use an embedded localstack instance that mocks/simulates the AWS SQS and other services.

## Getting Started

* Assuming you have gone through all the documentation and appropriate [steps](https://github.com/tibco/be-contribution/tree/main/channel) are followed to setup the new channel.

* Once 'AWS-SQS' channel is selected via the 'New Channel Wizard', various input fields based on the ones configured in 'drivers.xml' are available on the UI.

* In the Channel editor <b>Channel</b> tab, update the description as desired. The <b>Driver</b> field is set to AWS-SQS (as set in the wizard). The Method of Configuration must be set to Properties.
